Description: ConsensusTME is a consensus based approach to generating cancer
specific gene sets for multiple 
    cell types found within the tumour microenvironment. This package allows
    both generation and access to these genesets but also provides a wrapper
    for using these gene sets within the ssGSEA statistical framework to
    generate normalised enrichment scores. These can be used to identify
    relative quantities of the different cell types across multiple samples.
    This requires a bulk tumour gene expression profile as an input.
