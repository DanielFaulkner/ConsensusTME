Description: ConsensusTME is a consensus based approach to generating cancer
    specific gene sets for multiple 
    cell types found within the tumour microenvironment. This package allows
    access to these genesets and provides a wrapper
    for using these gene sets with various statistical frameworks to
    generate normalised enrichment scores. These can be used to identify
    relative quantities of cell types across multiple samples.
    This requires a bulk tumour gene expression profile as an input.
